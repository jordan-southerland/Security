###This evaluates a users IP address for access to log in

###This counts your login attempts and alerts a message that you are locked out after 3 failed attempts

#define function to count login attempts

###This will determine if a user is approved and if the device theyre using is the approved device

# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

    if username in approved_users:
        print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")

        # assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`,
        ind = approved_users.index(username)

        # and execute the following conditional
        # If `device_id` matches the element at the index `ind` in `approved_devices`, then display "______ is the assigned device for ______"
        if device_id == approved_devices[ind]:
          print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)

        # Otherwise, display "______ is not their assigned device"        
	else:
          print(device_id, "is not their assigned device.")

    # Otherwise (part of the outer conditional and handles the case when `username` does not belong to `approved_users`),
    # Display "The user ______ is not approved to access the system."
