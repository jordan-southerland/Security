Wireshark is a Network Protocol Analyzer used to open saved packet capture files, view high-level packet data, and filter files
to inspect detailed packet data. Here I demonstrate using filters to inspect packet data to sort through packet information efficiently.

#To filter for a speific IP Address
ip.addr == 142.250.1.139

#To filter for an IP source
ip.src == 142.250.1.139

#To filter for and IP destination
ip.dst == 142.250.1.139

#To filter a specific MAC address
eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02

#To filter for UDP port 53
udp.port == 53

#To filter for TCP port 80
tcp.port == 80

#To filter for TCP containing the phrase "curl"
tcp contains "curl"
