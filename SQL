In this project, I demonstrate the use of SQL to review databases of log-in attempts and employees log.

###Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00'
AND success = 0;

###Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date BETWEEN '2024-02-12' AND '2024-02-14';

###Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'Mex%';

###Retrieve employees in Marketing
SELECT employee_id, username FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing'
AND office LIKE 'East%';

###Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
SELECT employee_id username FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';

###Retrieve all employees not in IT
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'IT';
